### June 30, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 
Off day today for fieldtrip with the Wife up to L.A. for the Frida immersive exhibit and a stop at Highland Park Brewing. Recharge day before returning to the grind on Friday.

### June 29, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 
Finished reviewing class 16, focusing on functions and introducing loops, and began reviewing class 17.

**Thoughts** 
Still early days for the 100Devs JS content, so it's a lot of review for me. Still, valuable insight from Leon's instruction and the spaced repetition is working well to solidify my understanding of many of these foundational concepts.

**Today's Progress**: 

Today was geared more toward working through the Skillcrush curriculum, working with array methods, objects, and DOM manipulation.

### June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: 

Began viewing class 16 today. This is day 3 of the JavaScript content. It's still early days for the 100Devs JavaScript curriculum and thus a little basic for my current level of JS experience and understanding.

**Thoughts** 

Working concurrently through both the Skillcrush and Scrimba JavaScript/React-based FEWD curriculums.
