### July 5, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:
Began reviewing class 19, general JS review and intro the Arrays. 

**Thoughts** 
Additionally worked on some Code Wars challenges and refactoring my Guess-the-word game from the Skillcrush curriculum.

### July 1 - 4

**Today's Progress**: 
Lumping these days together due to holiday weekend. Watched all of the 9+ hour super review and began class 19 (arrays) of 100 Devs playlist. Also completed a re-code of my guess-the-word JS project from the Skillcrush curriculum.

**Thoughts** 
I'm still testing out this process of working through all the 100Devs recorded courses while concurrently working on more advanced JS work with Skillcrush and Scrimba curriculums. The 100Devs material is still mainly review at this point in the bootcamp, but there's so much useful insight from Leon spread out throughout the videos that I don't want to skip any. Plus, the review of fundamentals is always valuable, IMO.


### June 30, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 
Off day today for fieldtrip with the Wife up to L.A. for the Frida immersive exhibit and a stop at Highland Park Brewing. Recharge day before returning to the grind on Friday.

### June 29, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 
Finished reviewing class 16, focusing on functions and introducing loops, and began reviewing class 17.

**Thoughts** 
Still early days for the 100Devs JS content, so it's a lot of review for me. Still, valuable insight from Leon's instruction and the spaced repetition is working well to solidify my understanding of many of these foundational concepts. 

### June 28, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Today was geared more toward working through the Skillcrush curriculum, working with array methods, objects, and DOM manipulation. 

**Thoughts** 


### June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: 

Began viewing class 16 today. This is day 3 of the JavaScript content. It's still early days for the 100Devs JavaScript curriculum and thus a little basic for my current level of JS experience and understanding.

**Thoughts** 

Working concurrently through both the Skillcrush and Scrimba JavaScript/React-based FEWD curriculums.
