Today was geared more toward working through the Skillcrush curriculum, working with array methods, objects, and DOM manipulation.

**Today's Progress**: 

Began viewing class 16 today. This is day 3 of the JavaScript content. It's still early days for the 100Devs JavaScript curriculum and thus a little basic for my current level of JS experience and understanding.

**Thoughts** 

Working concurrently through both the Skillcrush and Scrimba JavaScript/React-based FEWD curriculums.
