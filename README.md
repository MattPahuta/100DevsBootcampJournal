# 100Devs Coding Bootcamp Journal

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Howdy! This journal is meant to document my activities while working through [Leon Noel's 100% free online coding bootcamp](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/) (Which is amazing, by the way) and provide a bit more accountability and motivation. 

I came to this program late, while it was in the midst of the 2nd cohort, and have been working through the recorded classes available on YouTube and all the associated materials. I'm starting this journal several weeks in (currently viewing class 16) but will look to update every day I'm working on 100Devs content or associated materials, so just about every day. 

Feel free to have a look at my log if you're curious about what I've been up to and/or get an idea about what to expect from 100Devs.
