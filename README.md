# 100Devs Coding Bootcamp Journal

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Howdy! This journal is meant to provide a bit more self-motivation and accountability as I continue to work through [Leon Noel's 100% free online coding bootcamp](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/). I came to this program late, while it was in the midst of the 2nd cohort and have been working through the recorded classes available on YouTube and all the associated materials.
